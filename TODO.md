# To Do

- Implement the rest of the Value types in MMDB
- Work out an error strategy. I need to make sure a corrupted database can't 
  cause any array out of bounds errors and kill the program.
- Eliminate all the `fatalError` calls in MMDB. Those are just me marking
  places I haven't implemented something.
