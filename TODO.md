# To Do

- Work out an error strategy. I need to make sure a corrupted database can't 
  cause any array out of bounds errors and kill the program.
- Eliminate all the `fatalError` calls in MMDB. Those are just me marking
  places I haven't implemented something.
- Add the 'bad' tests for the MaxMind test databases.
